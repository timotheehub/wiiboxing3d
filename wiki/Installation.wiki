#How to install Wiiboxing 3D

1. Download the files from: 

2. Before you can start playing, you need to pair the 2 wii-motes with the computer.

  - Start up the Bluetooth software on your computer and have it search for a device.

  - Hold down the 1 and 2 buttons on the Wii Remote. You should see the LEDs at the bottom  start flashing. Do not let go of these buttons until this procedure is complete.

  - The device should show up in the list of devices found as Nintendo RVL-CNT-01. If it's not there, start over and try again.

  - Click Next to move your way through the wizard. If at any point you are asked to enter a security code or PIN, leave the number blank or click Skip.

  - You may be asked which service to use for the Wii Remote. Select the keyboard/mouse/HID service.

  - The first wiimote that you paired will be used to track the movements of the other wiimote. Place this wiimote on something behind your computer, which is higher than your computer, like in the following picture:

  - You still have the second wii-mote to pair, so repeat the procedure above, expect for the last time - you don't have to place this wii-mote anywhere except your hands, as you'll be using this to punch.

  - Make sure your nunchuk is connected to the wiimote, now you're ready to launch the game and start playing!

3. Open the folder and open the file "WiiBoxing"
