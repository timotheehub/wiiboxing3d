For both the tutorials and career mode, there is a goal counter in red at the top right hand corner.

The player has to fulfill the goal in order to process to the next level, else he/she has to keep on trying.

Upon completion of level, meeting the goal, the goal counter will turn green as an indication to the player that he/she has cleared the level.
